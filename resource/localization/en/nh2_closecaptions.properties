1=<clr:205,201,201>Are you picking this up? Good.
2=<clr:205,201,201>First, allow me to introduce myself.
3=<clr:205,201,201>My name is Dr. Romero, and like you, I'm stuck in this hellhole.
4=<clr:205,201,201>There's been, complications, and as a result, we're cut off.
5=<clr:205,201,201>It's just you and I here, all alone. In a manner of speaking.
6=<clr:205,201,201>The good news is, I've heard that they're sending he--
7=<clr:205,201,201>goddamn it, I'm losing you!
8=<clr:205,201,201>Look, I'll explain everything when you get to me.
9=<clr:205,201,201>I'm unlocking the elevator doors for you. Just keep adva--
10=<clr:205,201,201>Hello? Can you hear me? Yes, I'm talking to you.
11=<clr:205,201,201>Look, if you want to get out of here, then do exactly as I say.
12=<clr:205,201,201>I know you have a lot of questions, but for now it's absolutely
13=<clr:205,201,201>vital that you get here as quickly as you can.
14=<clr:205,201,201>First, we're gonna have to get you armed.
15=<clr:205,201,201>Head to the cafeteria, then to the kitchen.
16=<clr:205,201,201>You'll find a surprise waiting for you there. You'll need it.
17=<clr:205,201,201>I see you found my axe.
18=<clr:205,201,201>God knows how it found it's way out here, but you should consider it a blessing.
19=<clr:205,201,201>You have no idea how much you're going to need it.
20=<clr:205,201,201>Things have gotten pretty ugly here.
21=<clr:205,201,201>I wish we could continue this pleasant conversation, but you'd better keep moving.
22=<clr:205,201,201>I'm unlocking the doors for you.
23=<clr:205,201,201>What the... How in the world did you get in here?
24=<clr:205,201,201>You're not supposed to... Whatever, just get out!
25=<clr:205,201,201>You see that thing? That's a nurse,
26=<clr:205,201,201>Or at least it was.
27=<clr:205,201,201>I have no idea if they're still alive or dead,
28=<clr:205,201,201>To be honest, I don't really want to know.
29=<clr:205,201,201>Just keep your distance every time you see one,
30=<clr:205,201,201>They should not trouble you so long as you don't trouble them.
31=<clr:205,201,201>Unlocking the doors, keep moving.
32=<clr:205,201,201>You're still alive! I thought you died or something.
33=<clr:205,201,201>I've lost track of you for like thirty minutes
34=<clr:205,201,201>No idea what happened but I'm glad you're back.
35=<clr:205,201,201>[breath]
36=<clr:205,201,201>Look, I know you can see her, she wants something from you.
37=<clr:205,201,201>Just... be careful.
38=<clr:205,201,201>Umm the rest of the hall is blocked by rubble, let me think...
39=<clr:205,201,201>Oh yeah, go back to the laundry room
40=<clr:205,201,201>If I'm right about this there should be an air vent behind the third washing machine.
41=<clr:205,201,201>Go check it out.
42=<clr:205,201,201>
43=<clr:205,201,201>
44=<clr:205,201,201>Same as it always was, isn't it?
45=<clr:205,201,201>The mind just keeps sending you back again.
46=<clr:205,201,201>It's interesting how you can find comfort in any familiar situation
47=<clr:205,201,201>Even in a familiar nightmare.
48=<clr:205,201,201>Wake up, It's time for the real nightmare to begin.

swat2_uhsir=<clr:255,254,131>Uh, sir... I don't think we should join someone we just met here.
swatl_thatswhy=<clr:58,198,244>That's exactly why we need him. If he was here before us then he knows his way around better than us, and we need that in order to complete the objective. Besides, he looks pretty sane to me.

swat3_sawsomething=<clr:139,255,116>Sir I think I saw something.
swatl_letsmove=<clr:58,198,244>Alright ladies, let's move.
swatl_leadus=<clr:58,198,244>You, since you're used to this place you won't mind leading us right?
swat1_whathappendhere=<clr:244,181,58>What exactly happened here again?
swatl_findout=<clr:58,198,244>That's what we need to find out.
hq_static=<clr:255,255,255>[Static]
50=<clr:205,201,201>I had a feeling I'd find you around this area.
51=<clr:205,201,201>Have you heard the good news? Help has arrived.
52=<clr:205,201,201>There is a helicopter patrolling the area outside this hospital as we speak.
53=<clr:205,201,201>The only problem is, my transmitter is being blocked by radio equipment inside the hospital.
54=<clr:205,201,201>I'm not in a position to contact them by light signal either.
55=<clr:205,201,201>Let me think for a second.
56=<clr:205,201,201>Oh, you've been through the surgery area, correct?
57=<clr:205,201,201>Then you're really close to the radio room.
58=<clr:205,201,201>Get there and shut off that equipment.
59=<clr:205,201,201>Then I'll be able to contact them, and we can get the [static] out of here.
romeroradiovoice7=<clr:205,201,201>The console is locked, find another way to shut it down.
romeroradiovoice8=<clr:205,201,201>
romeroradiovoice5_hint=<clr:205,201,201>I see you're stuck. Like I said, the air vent should be behind the third washing machine, in the laundry room.
romeroradiovoice5_hint2=<clr:205,201,201>C'mon, it's the third washing machine from the right, look behind there for an air vent, and get a move on.
63=<clr:205,201,201>You did it! I should be able to send a transmission within a couple minutes.
64=<clr:205,201,201>Uh, you better get out of there. The whole place is on fire.

l_welostaman=<clr:58,198,244>We lost a man!
2_mandown=<clr:255,254,131>Man down!
3_mandownmandown=<clr:139,255,116>Man down! man down!
200=<clr:205,201,201>Ah, there you are, I'm seeing you on the camera.
201=<clr:205,201,201>I only have limited access to the security channels around here, but I'll do my best to keep track of where you are.
202=<clr:205,201,201>Hold on, let me get those doors open.
203=<clr:205,201,201>Alright, keep moving ahead and... try to ignore the mess.
204=<clr:205,201,201>Emily! Listen! You are about to make a big mistake!
205=<clr:205,201,201>The Core! It's also -
206=<clr:205,201,201>Well would you look at that, the Core is still up and running.
207=<clr:205,201,201>I guess this means I win.
208=<clr:205,201,201>This is the Core, my life's long work, it's beautiful isn't it?
209=<clr:205,201,201>It's... important to me, and I'll go as far as needed in order to achieve my goals.
210=<clr:205,201,201>I've made some mistakes, sacrifices, my loved ones and even I myself.
211=<clr:205,201,201>But I have to continue, there is no turning back now.
212=<clr:205,201,201>I'm afraid I can't let you interfere, it's protecting me you see, keeping me safe, from her.
213=<clr:205,201,201>Therefore, I have to send a few friends to keep you company!
214=<clr:205,201,201>Let's see how long you can last against them, that's always a great experiment.
romero_getthehellaway=<clr:205,201,201>Seriously, get the hell away from the support beams.
romero_herecomesroundtwo=<clr:205,201,201>Oh you hadn't had enough yet? Alright, here's comes round two asshole.
romero_yourbullets=<clr:205,201,201>Your bullets won't do much round the Core radius, math and physics, you wouldn't understand.
2_againstlight=<clr:255,254,131>Seriously, who designed this place and what does he have against light?
2_boo=<clr:255,254,131>BOO! hahahaha.
2_goandflipswitch=<clr:255,254,131>Go ahead and flip the switch, it's right there.
2_herestheswtich=<clr:255,254,131>Here's the switch, flip it.
2_horrormovies=<clr:255,254,131>You do know what happens in the horror movies when the group splits up, right?
2_kickhisheadoff=<clr:255,254,131>Well, you can always kick someone's head off and use his helmet for extra armor.
2_manibethesfakingit=<clr:255,254,131>Man, I bet he's faking it, he's been slacking off ever since he found out he's leaving the force in a few weeks.
2_yeahletssplitup=<clr:255,254,131>Yeah let's all split up! You guys go look for the gate switch, this is total bullshit.
3_kickingrookie=<clr:139,255,116>Well, there was that one guy, a Rookie, he sure enjoyed kicking shit.
3_missleadus=<clr:139,255,116>You mislead us! We're never gonna get out of here because of you!
3_stayunarmed=<clr:139,255,116>You just gonna stay unarmed? What are you gonna do? Kick everyone to death?
3_thenoise=<clr:139,255,116>The noise! It's too strong! Stop it!
3_yeahjakesomething=<clr:139,255,116>Yeah, Jake something, what was it? Falcon...ground?
l_everyonekeepyoureyes=<clr:58,198,244>Everyone keep your eyes peeled! We're not alone here...
l_finalgoodluck=<clr:58,198,244>His name is Doctor Romero, find that asshole, and waste him, good luck...
l_finalhospital=<clr:58,198,244>This hospital, it's been abandoned for a while now, some things happened here, people went missing, and they just covered it all up.
l_finalmysquad=<clr:58,198,244>My squad and I, we were sent here to track him down, the man responsible for all of this.
l_finalpulse=<clr:58,198,244>However, not so long ago, they detected something beneath the hospital, a pulse, and then it all became clear.
l_finalthesamesignal=<clr:58,198,244>We found that same signal in the past, in that old house in the woods up north, we knew exactly who we were looking for, only that this time, he's got nowhere to run.
l_finalthissucks=<clr:58,198,244>[coughs]Well that sucks, I guess this is it for me, this mission went to hell real fast.
l_gobacktohell=<clr:58,198,244>Go back to hell you bastards!
l_holyshityesthisisalphasquad=<clr:58,198,244>Holy shit yes this is Alpha squad, we read you loud and clear, we have one MIA, one civilian, aborting mission, requesting EVAC, STAT.
l_likethatasshole=<clr:58,198,244>You like that, asshole?
l_ohnorunbackinsidenow=<clr:58,198,244>OH NO NO NO NO, RUN BACK INSIDE! NOW!
l_onelockeddoorisenough=<clr:58,198,244>Ok, one locked door is enough, we don't have time for this, move aside.
l_shitbehindus=<clr:58,198,244>Shit behind us!
l_thatswhyweneedhim=<clr:58,198,244>That's exactly why we need him, he seems to be pretty familiar with the place, and we need that in order to complete the objective, besides, I'm pretty sure he needs us just as much as we need him.
l_thatwasaclosecall=<clr:58,198,244>That was a close call, thanks for your help.
l_thatwasclosethanks=<clr:58,198,244>That was a close one, thanks.
l_thevent=<clr:58,198,244>OH SHIT THE VENT, HE'S IN THE GODDAMN VENT!
l_wedontkickpeople=<clr:58,198,244>We don't kick people to death in SWAT.
l_wegottogetthehelloutofhere=<clr:58,198,244>Oh my god we gotta get the hell out of here now, I know the way, follow me!
l_weneedtogetthisgateopen=<clr:58,198,244>We need to get this gate open, I'll stay here with him, you two go find the controls.
l_weneedtogettroughthisgate=<clr:58,198,244>We need to get through this gate, I'll stay here with him, you two see if you can find a way to open it.
l_what=<clr:58,198,244>What!?
l_youretalkingaboutthatnewguy=<clr:58,198,244>You're talking about that new guy, who works for Frank? Right?
l_youseemtoknowyourway=<clr:58,198,244>You, you seems like you know your way around here, do you mind taking point? don't worry, we'll cover you.
